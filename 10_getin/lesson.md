Up to this point, you have been working with either "hard-coded" data (for example, strings that are included in your code), or randomly generated data (for example, randomly selected numbers).

Python also allows us to ask the user of a program for text input, which the program can then process as string data.

We do this with the **input** command. The following expression:

    myinput = input("Type anything here:")

prints the prompt "Type anything here:", then waits for the user to type. When the user has finished typing and presses the return or enter key, the program will assign the text typed by the user, as a single string, to the variable **myinput**.


**Instructions for this exercise**

1. Run the existing program, interact with it, and observe its output.
2. Change the string that is printed as a prompt ("Type anything here:") to something more entertaining (e.g., "Type fast or die!").
3. Run and interact with the program again.
4. Click "submit" to submit your code.
