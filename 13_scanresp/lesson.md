This program does the following:

- Presents the user with an initial prompt ("How are you today?") and waits for input
- Defines a list of words associated with the topic of family
- Scans the user's input for words in the list of words associated with the topic of family
- If it finds a word associated with family, prints a specific response ("Tell me more about your family.") and waits for more input
- If it does not find a word associated with family, prints a general response ("What else do you want to talk about?") and waits for more input

**Instructions for this exercise**

1. Run the existing program.
2. Interact with it by typing a string that *does not* contain one of the strings in the list **family_words**, and observe its output.
3. Interact with it by typing a string that *does* contain one of the strings in the list **family_words**, and observe its output.
4. Modify the program so that it responds appropriately to words associated with the topic of *school*, rather than *family*. (For more of a challenge, modify the program so that it responds appropriately to words associated with the topic of *school* OR *family*.)
5. Click "submit" to submit your code.
