This is a slightly modified version of our random string generator, with some modifications to bring it closest to the spirit of Tzara's instructions for "How to Make a Dadaist Poem."

We'll go over these changes in class, but see if you can figure out how it works.


**Instructions for this exercise**

1. Copy a sequence of paragraphs from any web page. *Important: choose text that does not contain any double quotation marks â€” because we are using double quote marks to demarcate a string, here, any double quotation marks in your copied text may cause the program to fail.* Add your copied text as a string in the appropriate place in the program.
2. Run the program and observe its output.
3. Click "submit" to submit your code.
