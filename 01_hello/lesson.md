In writing in the English language, we use alphabetic letters, numerals or numeric digits, and typographic punctuation.

In computing, all of these different types of symbols are referred to collectively as *characters*, and sequences of characters are called *strings* (that is, characters that have been strung together, so to speak, into a larger unit of text).

A string is a data type that allows us to read and write text using a computer. It is quite different from the linguistic concepts *word*, *phrase*, *sentence*, *paragraph*, and so on, which developed over centuries of manuscript and print culture.

For example, a string can *include* the blank spaces that we use to separate English words. This means that all of the following are valid strings:

- "Testing"
- "Testing 123"
- "Testing 123, can you hear me?"

A beginning programmer is often asked to write a very simple program to print the phrase "Hello world" (or a similar phrase) on the screen. In the Python programming language, a "hello world" program looks like this:

    print("Hello world")

For this program to work, the text to be printed must be enclosed in quotation marks. This ensures it will be interpreted as a string. The string must then be enclosed in the parentheses that give the **print** command its *argument* (that is, the data we want that command to process).

**Instructions for this exercise:**

1. Run the existing program and observe its output.
2. Edit the string and run the program again to print the *exact* phrase "Hello world". Remember that text must be enclosed in quotation marks to ensure it is interpreted as a string.
3. Click "submit" to submit your code.
4. If your code fails the tests, check it for errors, correct, and submit again until it passes the tests.
