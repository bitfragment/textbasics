This program improves on the program in the previous exercise by randomly selecting a specific response from a list of specific responses.

**Instructions for this exercise**

1. Run the existing program.
2. Interact with it by typing a string that *does not* contain one of the strings in the list **family_words**, and observe its output.
3. Interact with it by typing a string that *does* contain one of the strings in the list **family_words**, and observe its output.
4. Modify the program so that it both (a) responds appropriately to words associated with the topic of *school*, rather than *family*, and (b) responds with one of three randomly selected specific responses. (For more of a challenge, modify the program so that it responds appropriately to words associated with the topic of *school* OR *family*.)
5. Click "submit" to submit your code.
