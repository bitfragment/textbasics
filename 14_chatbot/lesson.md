This program improves on the program in the previous exercise by randomly selecting a specific response from a list of specific responses.

**Instructions for this exercise**

1. Run the existing program.
2. Interact with it by typing a string that *does not* contain one of the strings in the list **family_words**, and observe its output.
3. Interact with it by typing a string that *does* contain one of the strings in the list **family_words**, and observe its output.
4. Modify the program so that it both (a) responds appropriately to words associated with the topic of *school*, rather than *family*, and (b) responds with one of three randomly selected specific responses. (For more of a challenge, modify the program so that it responds appropriately to words associated with the topic of *school* OR *family*.)
5. Make sure the program works before proceeding to step 6.
6. Try deliberately misspelling a relevant word when interacting with the program (for example, if you were still working with the version of the program that used family-related words, you could type "neice" instead of "niece"). Does the program still detect the misspelled word?
7. Try capitalizing a relevant word when interacting with the program (for example, if you were still working with the version of the program that used family-related words, you could type "Mother" instead of "mother"). Does the program still detect the capitalized word?
8. Click "submit" to submit your code.
