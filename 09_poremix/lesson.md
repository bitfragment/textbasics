**Instructions for this exercise**

This exercise is a preliminary version of an implementation of something similar to Raymond Queneau's *Cent mille milliards de po√®mes* (*A Hundred Thousand Billion Poems*).

1. Write a ten-line poem.
2. Complete the program so that the value of the variable **lines** is a list of the lines in your poem, each line being an individual string.
3. Run the program and observe its output.
4. Click "submit" to submit your code.
