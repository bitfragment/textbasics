This program implements a *phrasal template word game* like the old party game Mad Libs.

It prompts the user to enter words in various grammatical categories, storing each item of input as the string value of a variable with an appropriate name.

The value of the variable **result** is initialized as a sentence *template* containing a number of empty places or missing words.

Each word entered by the user is concatenated with the other strings forming the phrasal template, to fill the empty places.

**Instructions for this exercise**

1. Run the existing program, interact with it, and observe its output.
2. Modify the sentence template in some meaningful way. The existing template suggests that someone has jumped into a vehicle of some kind and driven away. That sense is still clear even when inappropriate words fill the empty places (the incongruity is often a source of humor).
3. Run and interact with the program again.
4. Click "submit" to submit your code.
